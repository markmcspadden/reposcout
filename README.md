# RepoScout

http://reposcout.com

RepoScout helps you quickly understand the activity AND community of any repository hosted on GitHub through a ScoutScore. Use the form below or download the Chrome Extension to view a ScoutScore anytime you are looking at a repo in Chrome.

RepoScout was created as part of the GitHub Data Challenge 2014.

# Components

Three sections of this repo:

* [Service](service): Tiny website and JSON endpoint for RepoScout. Currently live at http://reposcout.com
* [Chrome Extension](chrome_extension): Code for a Chrome Extension that lets you see a ScoutScore while browsing repos on GitHub
* [Practice](practice): The jumbled mess of scratch work that kicked off each component

# Terminology Note

You may find a lot of "health" references. RepoScout was RepoHealth before it was RepoScout. In an ideal world, all the references would have been changed. The world is not ideal.
