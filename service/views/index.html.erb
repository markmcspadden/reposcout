            RepoScout helps you quickly understand the <strong>activity AND community</strong> of any repository hosted on GitHub through a ScoutScore.
            Use the form below or download the Chrome Extension to view a ScoutScore anytime you are looking at a repo in Chrome.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything you find here is Open Source and is <a href="http://github.com/markmcspadden/reposcout">available on GitHub</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            RepoScout was created as part of the GitHub Data Challenge 2014.

              How do you decide that a repo is worth using?
            </h3>
            <p>
              For me, it usually involves some spelunking around GitHub to check out recent commits, issues and pull requests, and even things like watches and forks. And that's all before I even settle in to check out the README!
            </p>
            <p>
              You may have noticed that the process I <i>had</i> been using involved clicking on several links AND then reading. Clicking!?!? Reading!?!? These are two of the things I try to avoid on the internet! <strong>I needed something easier.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              And so I started writing a complicated piece of logic and assumptions in a form factor we call software. One calendar month, about 60 programming hours, and 37ish commits later I am ready to share <strong>RepoScout</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              RepoScout is a ruthlessly judgemental piece of software created to assess the activity and community around any given repo. It doesn't care about the fact that you never violated the Law of Demeter or that your Test Coverage is at 97.8%. It cares abouts Events, the currency of activity and community in regards to your repo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Utilizing the GitHub Events Timeline through Google Big Query, RepoScout looks at Watch, Fork, Issue, PullRequest, and Push Events over the last 90 days for your repo. It then uses a (somewhat overly complex) scoring system to arrive at a ScoutScore for your repo.
            </p>
            <p>
              And while it's nice to have a website like this as a home base for getting a ScoutScore for any repo, this site sadly does involve the dreaded aforementioned clicking, reading, and as if things could get any worse, TYPING!
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why I created the <strong>RepoScout Chrome Extension</strong>. This extension looks at any repo you do and quickly gets the ScoutScore for said repo, no clicking or typing required. (Clicking is required for detailed veiws. Also, it seems we are stuck with the "reading" requirement.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Have questions about how this "scoring system" I mentioned? Think you can do better? Read the code! Submit a pull request! (This repo could use the boost in ScoutScore!)
              <br/>
              Have questions about other things? I'm <strong>markmcspadden</strong> on GitHub and Twitter.

          <h3>
            There was an error in fetching the ScoutScore for this repo.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I've seen this happen a few different times. One possibility is that results are coming back slowly from BigQuery. (Yeah...I just said there's a chance Google is slow.) If this is the case, chances are if you try again things will work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second (and more likely) scenario is that for repos with LOTS of activity the transformation of that result to a score can get slow and bloated. I've only seens this on the top 20 repos by activity, but it's a possibility.
            <br/><br/>
            If this is the case, until something changes with ScoutScore computation, you can search over and over and you'll probably not get a score. If it's any consolation, your multi-re-search fury will be made known via my heroku and BigQuery bill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way, sorry you got an error, feel free to file an issue on GitHub and I'll take a look.
